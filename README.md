#Implementation of Univariate Linear Regression
AIM:
To implement univariate Linear Regression to fit a straight line using least squares.

Equipments Required:
Hardware – PCs
Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook
Algorithm
Get the independent variable X and dependent variable Y.
Calculate the mean of the X -values and the mean of the Y -values.
Find the slope m of the line of best fit using the formula.

4. Compute the y -intercept of the line by using the formula:

5. Use the slope m and the y -intercept to form the equation of the line. 6. Obtain the straight line equation Y=mX+b and plot the scatterplot.
